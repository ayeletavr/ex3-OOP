=============================
Spaceship:
A spaceship object carries crew members, lockers and a long-term storage.
Each object was implemented in a different class, even tough a locker and a long-tem storage has similar methods.

BoopingSite:
BoopingSite has 3 different sorting-hotels methods, that were implemented in BoopingSite.
I used Comprators, and also used three helper methods: 2 were implemented in HotelComprator,
and 1 in BoopingSite.

As described above.

=============================
i stored my information (both locker and LongTermLocker) by creating a counter for each legal item. It takes less memory that storing the items in arrays.

=============================
I resubmitted my assignment with changes of this lines: (also marked as comments as xxx)
SpaceshipTest.java - lines 36 and 46.
LockerTest.java - lines 47, 58, 64, 73, 75,77,83,89,95
LongTermTest.java - line 43
LongTermStorage.java - line 90
BoopingSiteTest.java - line 7,21,38 (deleted runtime = 60).
BoopingSite.java - line 64.

total change of 17 lines.

Main changes that I did:
1. I removed to my test annotations this command (runtime = 60) because I found out it is measured in ms and not in s,
and this command made my tests throw an exception.
2. I got confused and wrote most of my test in SpaceshipDepositoryTest with illegal objects
(for example - "plate" which is an object that I invented..).
From this reason I cannot run the whole SpaceshipTest, I would appreciate if you will consider that in mind.
3. I made a few changes in BoopingSiteTest.
